status: maintained, in development
notes:  Have feedback? Please send me an email. This project is still in its
        infancy, and will be changing rapidly.


Purpose
=======

For background, see: http://rdegges.com/deploying-django

Essentially--deploying Django projects is hard. There are lots of things you
need to take into consideration. Being a Django user for years, I believe I've
found some extremely useful patterns to help manage all sorts of Django sites
(from the very smallest apps, to the largest).

This project is meant to be a boilerplate project for starting development. It
is heavily opinionated in terms of services and tools--but I think the tradeoff
is worthwhile.


Docs
====

The full project documentation is hosted at RTFD: http://django-skel.rtfd.org/.
They are continuously updated to reflect changes and information about the
project, so be sure to read them before using this boilerplate.
